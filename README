--- The Game ---

It's terrible, you're thirsty, in the middle of a desert, and the only water 
left is really really precious. Suddenly, waves of fast-food burgers spawns 
from deep earth and starts rushing at your precious water. You MUST stop them 
before they reach it, only one burger could drink your entiere water reserve, 
there is no second chance!



--- Installation ---

At the root of the repository, juste enter the following shell command:

    make

This will compile and generate a `burgerinvasion' binary at the root of the 
repository. Juste launch the binary like this:

    ./burgerinvasion path

Where path is a path to a txt file that represent the map. Two maps are
provided in the res/ folder at the root. So you can call the game like so:

    ./burgerinvasion res/map1
    ./burgerinvasion res/map2

A single map will be different at every loading since some of the sand blocks 
are randomly transformed into bushes or rocks that will prevent the player 
from spawing towers on them.

--- Map Edition ---

You can create your own maps by making a text file, writing character inside, 
and call the game with the correct path. Here is the format of a map file:

Strictely 24 columns.
Strictely 18 rows.
Only characters that follow:

's' -> sand block, a block where you can land a tower
'p' -> path block, a block that represent a path
'b' -> begin block, the mob spawn (must be present once)
'e' -> end block, the finisht precious water (must be present once)

The 'p' characters should form a one-character width path from the 'b' char to 
the 'e' char. Example with the map map1:

ssssssssssssssssssssssss
ssssssssssssssssssssssss
ssbssssssssssppppppsssss
ssppssssssssspsssspsssss
ssspppppppssspssssppssss
ssssssssspssspssssspssss
ssssssssspppppssssspssss
ssssssssssssssssspppssss
sssspppppppppsssspssssss
sssspsssssssppppppssssss
sssspsssssssssssssssssss
sssspssssssppppsspppppps
sssspsssssspsspsspssssps
ssssppppppppssppppssssps
ssssssssssssssssssssssps
ssssssssssssssssssepppps
ssssssssssssssssssssssss
ssssssssssssssssssssssss



--- Playing ---

When you launch the game, you fall in the main menu. You can press the exit 
button to leave the game or start to begin the map you loaded.

While in game, you can press ESC on your keyboard to display PAUSE MENU.
In the pause menu, you can press EXIT to return to main menu or play to 
resume the game. You can also click on RESET to reset the whole game.
When you reset, you will stay in pause menu, just press start to continu again.

You have to ressources: money and score.

While your in the game, you need to place towers. By default your cursor is 
normal, you can only get an overview of the map. If you click on one of the 
towers on the left-bottom, you'll select it and you will be able to place it 
on sand by clicking (if you have enough money). You can press RIGHT click to 
return at any moment to the default cursor.

The game is divided into 7 waves, which goes in the following order:

-The practice wave
-The easy wave
-The medium wave
-The hard wave
-The insane wave
-The impossible wave
-The 'umad' wave

Good luck!
